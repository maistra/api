ExportedServiceSet is the Schema for configuring exported services. It must be created in the same namespace as the control plane. The name of the ExportedServiceSet resource must match the name of a ServiceMeshPeer resource defining the remote mesh to which the services will be exported. This implies there will be at most one ExportedServiceSet resource per peer and control plane.
